# PyQt5 Program

This repository contains a collection of Python programs developed using the PyQt5 library. PyQt5 allows for the creation of desktop applications with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python.

Feel free to explore the programs and use them as examples or starting points for your own PyQt5 projects.

## Watch Time Display

All programs in this repository now include a feature to display the watch time. The watch time shows the duration or elapsed time since the application was launched or a specific task was initiated. It allows users to keep track of the time spent using the application or performing certain actions.

To use the watch time feature in each program, simply run the program and observe the watch time display in the GUI. The watch time updates automatically as time passes.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from the official Python website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install pyqt5` in your command line or terminal.
4. Open the desired program in your preferred Python IDE or editor.
5. Run the program and interact with the GUI, while monitoring the watch time display.
